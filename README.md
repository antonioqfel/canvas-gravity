# Canvas gravity

Application creates a gravity based physics simulation using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

Gravity is a force that pulls objects towards a large body of mass (typically planets). This is easy to understand from a high level standpoint, but when it comes to translating this effect to code, we have to pay attention to the details. Technically, gravity is the accelerative speed added onto an object's velocity. If we continue to add a constant value (gravity) onto an object's velocity over time, the object's velocity will increase, thus creating the effect of acceleration / gravity.
